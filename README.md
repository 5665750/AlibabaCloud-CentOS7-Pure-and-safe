# AlibabaCloud-CentOS7-Pure-and-safe
Optimize and purify your Alibaba Cloud ECS instances.
My website: https://www.cxthhhhh.com


Features:
1. Remove Alibaba Cloud monitoring programs and block bad IPs with firewall to protect your privacy. Switch to other yum repositories. The Alibaba Cloud mirror lacks up-to-date packages and using those old packages may result in a security breach.

    (For Alibaba Cloud CentOS 7 +, not tested on other OSes.)

2. Optimize your network connection by installing LotServer and create a swap of 2 GB.

    (For all CentOS 7 systems, tested on Alibaba, Vultr, Azure, etc.) (Swap Location: /var/swapx)
